## Installation and Requirements

Friend Finder requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the express npm package. This repository includes a `package.json` file so all npm dependencies can easily be installed from the console with `npm i`.

## How to Use

Friend Finder is hosted on heroku at [https://friendaroos.herokuapp.com/](https://friendaroos.herokuapp.com/). There is a main page with a link to the survey.

To run on your local machine use:

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open your browser of choice and enter the following into the url bar:

```url
localhost:3000
```

The home page should display, you can then follow the link and fill out the survey.
